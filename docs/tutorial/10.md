Entities
--------

With the goal of making Markdown as HTML-agnostic as possible, all [valid HTML entities][] are recognized and converted into unicode characters

Named entities consist of `&` + any of the valid HTML5 entity names + `;` 

Some examples:

- `&amp;` &amp; 
- `&copy;` &copy;
- `&rarr;` &rarr;
