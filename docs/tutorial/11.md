Escaping
--------

If you have to write something that would result in a Markdown vaild syntax, you can escape the first character of your expression (you may also escape any other punctuation character) with a `\`

\*not emphasized\*

\<br/> not a tag

\[not a link](/foo)

\`not code`

1\. not a list

\* not a list

\# not a header

\[foo]: /url "not a reference"

You may also escape the backslash itself \\*like this*
